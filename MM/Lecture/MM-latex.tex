\subsection*{Microprocessors:}
\begin{verbatim}
    `-->Is a semiconductor device consisting of electronics logic circuit.
    `--->Manufactured by using various fabrication schemes.
    `---->Capable of performing computing functions.
    `----->Capable of transporting data/information.

    Can be divided into 3 segments:
        (-)Arithmetic adn logic unit
        (-)Registers unit
        (-)Control unit
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Von Neumann Machine:}
\begin{verbatim}
    Von Neumann machine may refer to: Von Neumann architecture, a conceptual model
    of nearly all computer architecture

    Three key concepts:
    (-)Data and instructions are stored in a single set of read-write memory.
    (-)Contents of memory are accessed by memory address without regard to the type
        of data.
    (-)Execution occurs in a sequential fashion, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
\end{verbatim}
